# Future_Intern

ðŸ“Œ Task 1 Overview :
As described on Future Interns, Taskâ€¯1 is a real-world project where you build an AIâ€‘powered predictive analytics dashboard to help retail businesses forecast future sales using historical transaction data. That includes cleaning data, modeling, and presenting insights via an interactive dashboard 

ðŸŽ¯ What Youâ€™ll Do
Clean and preprocess historical retail sales data

Engineer features: seasonality, trends, holiday spikes, monthly averages

Train a time series forecasting model (ARIMA, Facebook Prophet, XGBoost, etc.)

Build a dashboard (preferably in Power BI) showing actual vs. predicted sales

Highlight top categories, regional filters, and decision-oriented KPIs 

Provide business insights and recommendations based on the forecast

ðŸ›  Tools & Skills Used

Python (Prophet or ARIMA, Pandas, Scikitâ€‘learn)

Power BI Desktop for interactive dashboards

Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab) for EDA and model development

Excel for optional preprocessing

Forecasting performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)

ðŸ§ª Step-by-Step Prep Plan
1.Data Collection & Exploration

Gather a retail sales dataset (e.g. Rossmann sales or Kaggle retail sales)

Explore it in Pandas: detect missing data, seasonality, trends

2.Feature Engineering

Add calendar features: month, weekday, holiday indicators

Compute rolling averages or lagged sales features

3.Model Building

Train a Prophet model or classic time-series model (ARIMA/XGBoost)

Tune seasonality, holiday components, and trend hyperparameters

Evaluate using MAE, RMSE, MAPE

4.Dashboard Development

Use Power BI Desktop

Include visuals: line charts (actual vs forecast), error KPI cards, slicers by category/store/region

Add drilldowns or play-axis if possible

5.Insights & Reporting

Summarize forecast accuracy, trends, high/low season periods, category-level insights

Provide recommendations (e.g. inventory planning, promotions during dips)

6.Documentation or Demo

Prepare a concise great-looking presentation or video walkthrough explaining your dashboard and findings, similar to peer examples
